üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
To get this project up and running on your local machine, you'll need the following installed:

Java 21+

Maven 3.6+

MySQL 8.0+

An API client like Postman or Insomnia to test the endpoints.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-fit-journey-backend.git
cd my-fit-journey-backend

Database Configuration:
Create a new MySQL database. Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file and update the database connection details.

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

The ddl-auto=update setting will automatically create the database tables on application startup.

Run the Application:
You can run the application directly from your IDE or use the Maven command line.

mvn spring-boot:run

The application will start on http://localhost:8080.

üîë API Endpoints
All endpoints are protected by JWT authentication, with the exception of the /api/auth/ routes.

Authentication
Register a new user:
POST /api/auth/register

Example Request Body:

{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "password": "password123",
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "role": "MEMBER"
}

Available roles: ADMIN, TRAINER, MEMBER

Log in and get a JWT token:
POST /api/auth/login

Example Request Body:

{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "password": "password123"
}

Example Response:

{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}

You must include this token in the Authorization header of all subsequent protected requests as a Bearer token.
